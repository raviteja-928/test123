# 1) what are the key features of python?
''' # Python is free and open-source.
    # It is an object-oriented language.
    # Easy to learn due to its clear syntax and readability.
    # Eas to interpret, making debugging very easy.
    # Easily integrated with other languages like C++, Java and more.


# 2) What are keywords in python?
'''  # Keywords are reserved words which are used as identifiers, function names and more.
     # They help the structure and syntax of the language.
     # There are 33 keywords in Python 3.7 and they are:
     # False,  None,    True,    and,       as,
     # assert, break,   class,   continue,  def,
     # del,    elif,    else,    except,    finally, 
     # for,    from,    global,  if,        import, 
     # in,     is,      lambda,  nonlocal,  not, 
     # or,     pass,    raise,   return,    try, 
     # while,  with,    yield ''' 

# 3) What are literals in Python?
''' # Literals in python refer to the data is given in a variable or constant.
    # They are four type of literals:
    ''' # String literals - Sequece of characters enclosed in quotes
        # Numeric literals - Integer, float and complex numbers
        # Boolean literals - Represents True or False

# 4) How can you conctenate(join) two tuples?
# consider two tuples:

tup1 = (1, "a", True)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)

# what does tup1 + tup2 do?

print(tup1 + tup2)     # (1, 'a', True, 4, 5, 6)


# 5) What are functions in Python?
''' # Functions in Python refer to blocks that are organized, reusable
      pieces of code that perform single, and related events.
    # Functions are important to create better modularity for applications
      which reuse high degree of coding.
    # Python has a number of built-in functions like print() and allows of
      user-defined functions as well.
